# Stress-Level Management via Smartwatch Monitoring

**A complete end-to-end IoT solution for real-time stress detection. This system utilizes a hybrid Deep Learning model (CNN+GRU) deployed on a Wear OS smartwatch to analyze sensor data, syncs results via Firebase, and visualizes live stress events on a React web dashboard.**

## 🎯 Overview

Stress is a prevalent health issue affecting productivity and well-being. While many wearables track heart rate, few offer **real-time, medical-grade stress classification**.

This project implements a **Multimodal Stress Monitoring System** that:

1. **Analyzes** physiological data (HRV, EDA, BVP, Temp) using Deep Learning.
2. **Performs Inference** directly on the wearable device (Edge AI).
3. **Streams** data to the cloud for remote monitoring.

The system was developed through rigorous phases: from EDA and baseline LSTM models to a refined **Hybrid CNN + GRU** architecture optimized for mobile deployment.

## 🎥 Demos & Live Dashboards

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The solution consists of three main components connected via the cloud:

1. **Wearable Device (Android):** Simulates sensor data collection and runs the `.pt` (PyTorch Lite) model for on-device inference.
2. **Backend (Firebase):** Acts as the real-time bridge, storing sensor readings and stress labels with timestamp validation.
3. **Frontend (React Dashboard):** A live interface for visualizing stress trends, heart rate variability, and historical logs.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

We experimented with 9 different architectures before finalizing the edge model.

![ML Pipeline Diagram](Diagrams/ml_pipeline_diagram.png)

### 1. Data Processing

- **Input:** 30-second windows of physiological signals (BVP, EDA, Temp).
- **Preprocessing:** Normalization, Sliding Window Segmentation.
- **Feature Selection:** Reduced input size to **5 critical features** (`MEAN_RR`, `SDRR`, `RMSSD`, `HR`, `pNN50`) to ensure high performance on limited smartwatch hardware.

### 2. Model Evolution

- **Baseline:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
- **Intermediate:** Bi-LSTM (inspired by xLSTM) and ResNet.
- **Top Performers:** CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units).

### 3. Final Architecture: Hybrid CNN + GRU

For the wearable application, we combined the strengths of both top models:

- **CNN Layers:** Extract spatial features (patterns in physiological spikes) from sensor signals.
- **GRU Layers:** Capture temporal dependencies over the 30-step window. It is faster and more "mobile-friendly" than a standard LSTM.
- **Performance:** The hybrid model showed realistic generalization (avoiding pure CNN overfitting) and was exported as `stress_model.pt` for Android.

## 📱 Prototypes

### ⌚ Wearable App (Kotlin)

Built in **Android Studio**. It reads sensor data (simulated for testing stability), processes it through the PyTorch model, and displays:

- Real-time BPM.
- Stress Label (Relaxed, Stressed, Interrupted).
- Uploads data to Firebase (optimized with debounce to prevent API spam).

### 💻 Web Dashboard (React.js)

A Dark-mode UI hosted on **Firebase**.

- **Live Connection:** Listens to Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Visuals:** Dynamic cards with Sparkline charts for heart rate.
- **Alerts:** Visual feedback for "Stressed" (Red) or "Interrupted" (Yellow) states.

## 📊 Results

- **Comparison:** The CNN model initially showed the highest accuracy on the static dataset.
- **Generalization:** The Hybrid CNN+GRU proved most robust for stream data, balancing precision with computational efficiency.
- **Latency:** The full pipeline (Watch -> Cloud -> Web) achieves sub-second latency for live updates.

### Final Model Performance

The Hybrid CNN+GRU model achieved a **97% accuracy** on the final test set, demonstrating robust classification across all stress categories without significant overfitting.
